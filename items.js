We spent a couple of years working for &quot;the man&quot;...at a desk eight hours a day...fifty weeks a year.\r\n\r\nWe finally decided to follow our dream of becoming entrepreneurs, pursue our passion, and determine our own future with hands on approach.

Personalization is included in the cost of our products with the purchase of any of our standard monograms or designs. However, if you request a custom order which requires additional personalization or additional labor to complete the design, additional fees may apply. We also offer additional personalization options for many of the products we sell including, but not limited to, personalizing both sides of glassware and cutting boards and personalizing multiple items on the same product listing. All of the products we sell are personalized and customers who place an order requesting our products without personalization will have their orders placed on hold until information for personalization is submitted. If we do not receive a response, we will personalize the product purchased with the information, font, and design option shown in the main product image if we are unable to receive a response.\r\n\r\nCAN ADDITIONAL PERSONALIZATION BE ADDED TO AN ORDER: Yes, Design&#39;s the Limit specializes in custom orders and we are happy to assist customers with special requests. We recommend messaging us before placing an order, but the customer can place their order and enter the request and we will message with further information.

It is the customer&#39;s responsibility to identify the first, last, and middle initial and state the monogram rule they prefer at the time of purchase. Orders which do not specify monogram style may be produced as entered at the time of purchase by the customer and will be filled with the standard monogram style. It is the customer&#39;s responsibility to enter their information, specify monogram style, and to request a proof.

Yes, Design&#39;s the Limit specializes in custom orders and can convert your image for personalization on any of the products we sell. Please e-mail images to us at info@designsthelimit.com. We include a design fee to convert images for personalization, but the design fee varies depending on the complexity of the design and amount of labor required to prepare your image for personalization.

Please submit your image and message us prior to placing your order or additional fees may apply. Please read additional shop policies pertaining to the submission of text or images below.\r\n\r\nCAN I REQUEST A FONT NOT SHOWN ON THE FONT LIST? Yes, Design&#39;s the Limit has a large quantity of fonts available for personalization. We have more fonts than we can display and have created our font lists to showcase a variety of font styles.

Please read additional policies pertaining to the submission of images below and let us know if you have any questions or concerns.. LISTING: https:\/\/www.etsy.com\/listing\/186169097\r\n\r\nDESIGN&#39;S THE LIMIT CUSTOM ARTWORK! Custom made or one of a kind, Design&#39;s the Limit will create a piece of art to your specifications on a piece of glass or mirror to your specified dimensions and ship it to you. We are only limited by the inspiration you provide! Design&#39;s the Limit offers custom made display artwork for your special interest or desire. When you place your order, the non-refundable deposit will allow us to create and submit a design proof and estimate for your approval based on the information and the inspiration you provide. You do not have the rights to reproduce the designs we submit and your deposit is strictly for the time to create your design and estimate the cost of completing and shipping your artwork with Design&#39;s the Limit reserving the rights to the designs which may not be reproduced by others under any circumstances. Design&#39;s the Limit reserves the rights to all of our images and artistic creations as the sole intellectual property of Design&#39;s the Limit, LLC. Reproduction of our images or artwork is strictly prohibited. Every piece of artwork we produce will include a signature (and print number unless created as a one-of-a-kind unique design masterpiece). When specified as a one-of-a-kind design before making a purchase, we will never again reproduce the image we create for you to make your artwork a truly unique artistically inspired design creation. DESIGN&#39;S THE LIMIT&#39;S CUSTOM DISPLAY ARTWORK - \r\nMASTERPIECE LISTING: https:\/\/www.etsy.com\/listing\/176383600\r\n\r\nWHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN ETCHED, ENGRAVED, AND CARVED?\r\nWhen it comes to personalizing, there is such a wide variety of artists and styles available that we can not cover them all in this explanation. Design&#39;s the Limit employs a combination and variety of techniques including occasional chemical etching, laser engraving for many items, and sandblasted carving depending on the item, the desired effect, and the customer request. Laser engraving offers many advantages, but has it&#39;s own limitations and sandblasted carving gives a desired effect while delaying completion time and increasing costs. Design&#39;s the Limit offers a sandblasted listing for any glassware purchase and for all customer&#39;s who prefer the method of sandblasting: SANDBLASTING: https:\/\/www.etsy.com\/listing\/176565485\/sandblast\r\n\r\nCAN I ORDER MY BEER MUG OR COFFEE CUP HANDED? Yes, if you specify that you would like your mug for left handed or right handed orientation Design&#39;s the Limit will fill your order as you have requested at no additional charge. As there is no consensus as to the proper orientation and we often fill orders with engraving on both sides of the mug, we generally complete orders as shown in the main product images. Unless the customer specifies the desired handing at the time of purchase, we reserve the right to complete each order as we see fit depending on the characteristics of the mugs purchased and the design specified. Please let us know if you have any questions or special requests and we would be happy to complete your order to your specifications. We do not accept buyers remorse and it is the customers responsibility to specify handing when making a purchase.\r\n\r\nIS THE GLASSWARE DISHWASHER SAFE? They are dishwasher safe, the engraving is permanently engraved, and the designs will not come off. Tatiana and I have a difference of opinion on this matter, as she believes that some dishwashers and some dish detergents will leave small scratches on any glass. She recommends hand-washing with warm water and a soft, non-abrasive sponge. We put a lot of effort into creating our art, so we hand-wash them before packaging. Our designs are permanently engraved in the glassware we sell and cannot be removed in the dishwasher. It is the customers responsibility and decision on the method of cleaning the products, but we recommend cleaning thoroughly when you products arrive before use. We assume no liability for the glassware other than the artistic service we provide.\r\n\r\nARE THE CUTTING BOARDS FOOD SAFE? The cutting boards and cheese boards are permanently engraved. We like to say the design is already there and just needs to be uncovered. We do not add any product that is not considered food safe to the surface of any of our cutting boards or cheese boards. We recommend cleaning your products thoroughly when they arrive before using and accept no liability for the products we sell only the artistic service we provide. Please read hold-harmless policy below. NOTE: Do not submerge cutting boards or cheese boards in water, surface wash with damp cloth with water only. Do not clean with any substance other than water and do not put in the dishwasher. Submerging wood in water or running through the dishwasher will cause the product to warp or crack and all sales are final. Recommend applying food safe cutting board oil on a semi-regular basis to extend the life of the product.\r\n\r\nARE CRYSTAL GLASSES SAFE? We sell 100 % Lead-Free Crystal in almost every instance, but as we are not the manufacturer of the crystal can not accept any liability for the use of crystal products. Although generally accepted as safe for use during short periods of time and on an infrequent basis, leaded crystal stemware and decanters pose a significant health risk and proper cleaning and handling instructions should be followed with every use. Design&#39;s the Limit recommends washing thoroughly before and after each use. Design&#39;s the Limit does not recommend storing liquids in the leaded crystal products for longer than needed to entertain and never more than a few hours. Leaded crystal products should be used responsibly by consenting adults only. Design&#39;s the Limit recommends all customers not familiar with leaded crystal products research the subject independently and all customers accept responsibility for the products they purchase and agree to hold Design&#39;s the Limit harmless in accordance with our shop policies. Many of the crystal decanters and crystal stemware we offer are 100% lead free optic crystal and are considered safe for storing liquids in for longer periods of time. Please click &quot;Ask a Question,&quot; if you would like additional information about any other products we sell. Leaded crystal product listings are identified as such in the product information.\r\n\r\nCAN I ORDER MY PEN OR PENCIL SET HANDED? You can specify handing for a pen or pencil at the time of purchase, but it is not necessary. When you place an order for a pen or pencil with engraving on one side, we engrave your name or information opposite the pen clip. If you specify or purchase engraving on both sides, we engrave your name or information on both sides of the pen or pencil. You can also choose to specify a name on one side of the pen and a job title, company name, or other information on the opposite side of the pen or pencil. Our listing for the metal pen includes three sides which you may choose to have engraved with different information on each side. Design is Limited only by your requests. Design the time to make your personal gift perfectly unique.\r\n\r\nDOES THE TOOTHBOX LID FIT TIGHTLY? Yes, the lid does not fall off if you turn the toothbox upside down and it is perfect for storing teeth and putting under the pillow. To remove the top you have to wiggle or twist is slightly. It is the customers responsibility to use the toothbox properly including cleaning anything you wish to store and drying prior to storage for an extended period of time. Design&#39;s the Limit accepts no responsibility for the box, only the artwork provided for personalization and the toothbox is not a food safe item in which a food safe finish has been applied.\r\n\r\nDO YOU OFFER QUANTITY DISCOUNTS OR OTHER PROMOTIONS: Design&#39;s the Limit offers an increasing percentage discount based on the quantity purchased of any item in our shop. Design&#39;s the Limit also posts coupon codes and special offers on Twitter and our Facebook page and ask all customers to please like and share before using the coupon codes found there. Design&#39;s the Limit will not retroactively issue refunds for quantity discounts, so make sure to use select the appropriate listing for the quantity you wish to purchase, request a custom listing for any quantity over one dozen, and enter the coupon code at the time of purchase. Please click &quot;Request a Custom Order&quot; and we will create a listing for any quantity you wish to purchase if you include your zip code for shipping. All of the products we sell are intended to be used or given as gifts by the customer who purchases them. We do not offer products for wholesale and do not give any of our customers the right or permission to resell any of the items in our shop without contacting us before they place an order. All sales are final and we encourage all of our customers to read the product listings, read our shop policies, and contact us for any questions they may have before making a purchase.\r\n\r\nWHAT IF THE PRODUCT IS DAMAGED IN SHIPPING? Design&#39;s the Limit makes every effort to ensure that your product arrives safely, but occasionally shipping damage does occur.
